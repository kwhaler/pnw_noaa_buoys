# Oregon Surf

This R script scrapes data from NOAA's National Data Buoy Center, then plots it on a Leaflet Map.

Only one buoy was sourced but you could imagine looping through several and plotting them. This would give you a decent idea of Oregon surf conditions.

Data: [Station 46050 (LLNR 641) - STONEWALL BANK - 20NM West of Newport, OR](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=46050)
